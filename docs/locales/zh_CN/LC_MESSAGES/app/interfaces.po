"The only way provided by ``Control.App`` to run an ``App`` is via the "
"``run`` function, which takes a concrete list of errors ``Init``. All "
"concrete extensions to this list of errors are via either ``handle``, to "
"introduce a new exception, or ``new``, to introduce a new state. In order"
" to compose ``App`` programs effectively, rather than introducing "
"concrete exceptions and state in general, we define interfaces for "
"collections of operations which work in a specific list of errors."

"``Control.App`` 提供的运行 ``App`` 的唯一方法是通过 ``run`` 函数，"
"它接收一个具体的错误列表 ``Init`` 。对这个错误列表的所有具体扩展都是通过 "
"``handle`` 以引入一个新的异常，或者 ``new`` 以引入一个新状态。为了有效地组成 "
"``App`` 程序，而不是笼统地引入具体的异常和状态，我们为在特定错误列表中工作的"
"操作集合定义接口。"

"We use ``primIO`` to invoke an ``IO`` function. We also have a ``fork`` "

"There is an implementation of ``PrimIO`` for a list of errors which can "
"throw the empty type as an exception. This means that if ``PrimIO`` is "

"Console I/O can be implemented directly, but most I/O operations can "

"While precise, this becomes unwieldy when there are long sequences of "
"``IO`` operations. Using ``App``, we can provide an interface which "
"throws an exception when an operation fails, and guarantee that any "
"exceptions are handled at the top level using ``handle``. We begin by "
"defining the ``FileIO`` interface, in ``Control.App.FileIO``:"

"One could also imagine an interface using a linear resource for the file,"
" which might be appropriate in some safety critical contexts, but for "
"most programming tasks, exceptions should suffice. All of the operations "
"can fail, and the interface makes this explicit by saying we can only "
