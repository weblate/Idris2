"First of all, we should know that Idris2 is not an optimizing compiler. "
"Currently its focus is only to compile dependently typed functional code "
"in a timely manner. Its main purpose is to check if the given program is "
"correct in a dependently typed setting and generate code in form of a "
"lambda-calculus like IR where higher-order functions are present. Idris "
"has 3 intermediate representations for code generation. At every level we"

"As a summary, a custom back-end for the Idris compiler should create an "
"environment in the host technology that is able to run Idris programs. As"
" Idris is part of the family of functional programming languages, its "
"computation model is based on graph reduction. Programs represented as "
"simple graphs in the memory are based on the closure creation mechanism "
"during evaluation. Closure creation exist even on the lowest levels of "
"IRs. For that reason any runtime in any host technology needs to support "
"some kind of representation of closures and be able to store them on the "
"heap, thus the responsibility of memory management falls on the lap of "
"the implementor of the custom back-end. If the host technology has memory"
" management, the problem is not difficult. It is also likely that storing"
" closures can be easily implemented via the tools of the host technology."

"There is an operation called ``unsafePerformIO`` in the ``PrimIO`` "
