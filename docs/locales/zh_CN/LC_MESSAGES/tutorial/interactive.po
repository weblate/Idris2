"By now, we have seen several examples of how Idris’ dependent type system"
" can give extra confidence in a function’s correctness by giving a more "
"precise description of its intended behaviour in its *type*. We have also"
" seen an example of how the type system can help with embedded DSL "
"development by allowing a programmer to describe the type system of an "
"object language. However, precise types give us more than verification of"
" programs — we can also use the type system to help write programs which "
"are *correct by construction*, interactively."

"The Idris REPL provides several commands for inspecting and modifying "
"parts of programs, based on their types, such as case splitting on a "
"pattern variable, inspecting the type of a hole, and even a basic proof "
"search mechanism. In this section, we explain how these features can be "
"exploited by a text editor, and specifically how to do so in `Vim "
"<https://github.com/edwinb/idris2-vim>`_. An interactive mode for `Emacs "
"<https://github.com/idris-hackers/idris-mode>`_ is also available, "
"updated for Idris 2 compatibility as of 23 February 2021."

"The Idris2 repl does not support readline in the interest of keeping "
"dependencies minimal. Unfortunately this precludes some niceties such as "
"line editing, persistent history and completion. A useful work around is "
"to install `rlwrap <https://linux.die.net/man/1/rlwrap>`_, this utility "
"provides all the aforementioned features simply by invoking the Idris2 "
"repl as an argument to the utility ``rlwrap idris2``"
