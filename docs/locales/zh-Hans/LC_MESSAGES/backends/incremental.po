"By default, Idris 2 is a whole program compiler - that is, it finds all the "
"necessary function definitions and compiles them only when you build an "
"executable. This gives plenty of optimisation opportunities, but can also be"
" slow for rebuilding. However, if the backend supports it, you can build "
"modules and executables *incrementally*. To do so, you can either:"

"executable will attempt to link all of the compiled modules together, rather"

"all the imported modules *must* have been built with incremental compilation"
" for the current back end (Idris will revert to whole program compilation if"

"Incremental compilation means that executables are generated much quicker, "

" means that there are fewer optimisation opportunities, so the resulting "
"executable will not perform as well. For deployment, ``--whole-program`` "
"compilation is recommended."
